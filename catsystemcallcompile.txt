To compile give the command as 
at the prompt $ gcc catsystemcall.c (the name of the program created in this case it is catsystemcall.c)
you will get some warning ignore it
execute it as follows
at the prompt $ ./a.out a.txt (here a.txt should have been created some text file and the same content will be displayed once you execute the program ok)
